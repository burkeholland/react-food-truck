### [ES6 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)

All the best ES6 snippets at your finger tips. Why type `import` when you can
type `imp`? It's three letters shorter. That's called productivity.

Add this to your User Preferences file for that premium "format on save"
experience.

```

### [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Your JavaScript is so solid, you don't need a linter. But if you did, it would
be ESLint and you would use this extension.

You can force Prettier to respect your ESLint rules by adding the following line
to your User Settings...

```
"prettier.eslintIntegration": true
```

your imports.

### [React Pure To Class](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=angryobject.react-pure-to-class-vscode)

Do you need a class or a pure component? Nobody ever knows until they make a
component and then realize this thing isn't nearly as dumb as they thought it
was going to be and NOW they need a class. REFACTORING SUCKS. Converting pure
components to classes is a breeze with this extension.
